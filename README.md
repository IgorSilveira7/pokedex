# Pokedex

A pokedex application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) that aims to be simple and easy to understand by beginners. All data is fetched from the amazing [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It is available at https://paulojbleitao.github.io/pokedex/.

## Dependencies

To run the Pokedex locally, you need to have `npm` or `yarn` (preferably `yarn`) installed on your machine. After cloning the project, simply running `yarn install` followed by `yarn start` will get the application up and running on http://localhost:3000.

## Contributing

After getting the app running, you can proceed to editing the code! You can check out open [issues](https://github.com/paulojbleitao/pokedex/issues) or create your own if you want to fix a bug, create a new feature or do something else. Don't be afraid to get in touch!
